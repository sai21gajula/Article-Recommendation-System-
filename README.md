# Cluster Based Article Recommneder System

## Project Overview
This project develops an advanced article recommendation system that leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide personalized article recommendations. The system combines content-based filtering, principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and TF-IDF vectorization to create a sophisticated tool for recommending articles based on user preferences and content relevance.

## Key Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Analyzes the content of articles and matches them with user profiles created from their past interactions, ensuring recommendations are personalized and relevant.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Employs PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the TF-IDF features, which improves the efficiency of the recommendation engine and focuses on the most significant features.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text data into a feature matrix where each word or phrase's importance is inversely proportional to its frequency across all documents, highlighting unique aspects of each article.

## System Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, SciPy, sklearn, nltk, spacy

## Installation
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-article-recommender.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd advanced-article-recommender

# Install required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Execute the recommendation system with the following command:
```python
python recommend.py
```

## Data Description
- **Articles Dataset**: Contains detailed metadata for each article including title, author, and the full text content.
- **User Interactions Dataset**: Includes data on user actions (e.g., views, likes, and shares) which is used to construct dynamic user profiles.

## Data Preprocessing
- **Text Normalization**: Includes converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation and special characters, and stripping extra spaces.
- **Stop Words Removal**: Filters out common words that do not contribute to the semantic meaning of the texts.
- **Tokenization**: Splits text into individual elements or tokens.
- **TF-IDF Application**: Transforms the cleaned text into a numerical representation that highlights the most important words.

## Visualization
- **PCA Variance Plot**: Displays a line plot of the cumulative variance explained by the principal components to determine how many components are necessary for a good balance of information retention and feature reduction.
- **Recommendation Strength Distribution**: Visualizes the strength of recommendations using histograms or bar charts to evaluate the model's confidence in its suggestions.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Hit Rate**: Measures whether the recommended articles are relevant to the user's interests.
- **Precision and Recall**: Assesses the accuracy of the recommendations in terms of relevance and completeness.
- **F1 Score**: Combines precision and recall into a single metric to provide a balanced view of model performance.
- **NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)**: Evaluates the ranking quality of the recommended articles, giving more importance to highly relevant articles appearing earlier in the list.
